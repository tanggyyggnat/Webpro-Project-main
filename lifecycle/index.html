    <div class="text-4xl font-bold">Component Lifecycle</div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">A component instance has a lifecycle that starts when Angular instantiates the component
      class and renders the component view along with its child views. The lifecycle continues with change detection, as
      Angular checks to see when data-bound properties change, and updates both the view and the component instance as
      needed. The lifecycle ends when Angular destroys the component instance and removes its rendered template from the
      DOM. Directives have a similar lifecycle, as Angular creates, updates, and destroys instances in the course of
      execution. </div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">
      Your application can use lifecycle hook methods to tap into key events in the lifecycle of a component or
      directive
      to initialize new instances, initiate change detection when needed, respond to updates during change detection,
      and
      clean up before deletion of instances.</div>

    <div class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8">Prerequisites</div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">Before working with lifecycle hooks, you should have a basic understanding of the
      following:
    </div>
    <ul class="list-disc mt-4 ml-8">
      <li class="mt-2"><a>TypeScript programming</a></li>
      <li class="mt-2">Angular app-design fundamentals, as described in Angular Concepts</li>

    <div class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8">Responding to lifecycle events</div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">Respond to events in the lifecycle of a component or directive by implementing one or more
      of the lifecycle hook interfaces in the Angular core library. The hooks give you the opportunity to act on a
      component or directive instance at the appropriate moment, as Angular creates, updates, or destroys that instance.
    </div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">
      Each interface defines the prototype for a single hook method, whose name is the interface name prefixed with ng.
      For example, the OnInit interface has a hook method named ngOnInit(). If you implement this method in your
      component or directive class, Angular calls it shortly after checking the input properties for that component or
      directive for the first time.

    </div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">You don't have to implement all (or any) of the lifecycle hooks, just the ones you need.
    </div>
    <div class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8">Lifecycle event sequence
    </div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">After your application instantiates a component or directive by calling its constructor,
      Angular calls the hook
      methods you have implemented at the appropriate point in the lifecycle of that instance.
      <br>
      Angular executes hook methods in the following sequence. Use them to perform the following kinds of operations.
