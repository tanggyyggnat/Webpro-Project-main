    <div class="text-4xl font-bold">Understanding binding
    </div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">In an Angular template, a binding creates a live connection between a part of the UI
      created
      from a template (a
      DOM element, directive, or component) and the model (the component instance to which the template belongs). This
      connection can be used to synchronize the view with the model, to notify the model when an event or user action
      takes place in the view, or both. Angular's Change Detection algorithm is responsible for keeping the view and the
      model in sync.</div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">Examples of binding include:</div>
    <ul class="list-disc mt-4 ml-8">
      <li class="mt-2">
        text interpolations
      </li>
      <li class="mt-2">property binding</li>
      <li class="mt-2">event binding</li>
      <li class="mt-2">two-way binding</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">Bindings always have two parts: a target which will receive the bound value, and a
      template expression which
      produces a value from the model.</div>

    <div class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8">Syntax</div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">Template expressions are similar to JavaScript expressions. Many JavaScript expressions
      are legal template expressions, with the following exceptions.</div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">You can't use JavaScript expressions that have or promote side effects, including:</div>
    <ul class="list-disc mt-4 ml-8">
      <li class="mt-2">
        Assignments (=, +=, -=, ...)
      </li>
      <li class="mt-2">
        Operators such as new, typeof, or instanceof
      </li>
      <li class="mt-2">
        Chaining expressions with ; or ,
      </li>
      <li class="mt-2">
        The increment and decrement operators ++ and --
      </li>
      <li class="mt-2">
        Some of the ES2015+ operators
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">Other notable differences from JavaScript syntax include:</div>
    <ul class="list-disc mt-4 ml-8">
      <li class="mt-2">No support for the bitwise operators such as | and &
      </li>
      <li class="mt-2">
        New template expression operators, such as |
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8">
      Expression context
    </div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">Interpolated expressions have a context—a particular part of the application to which the
      expression belongs. Typically, this context is the component instance.</div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">In the following snippet, the expression recommended and the expression itemImageUrl2
      refer to properties of the AppComponent.</div>
    <div>
      <center><img src="assets/carbon (17).png" width="600"></center>
    </div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">An expression can also refer to properties of the template's context such as a template
      input variable or a
      template reference variable. <br>
      The following example uses a template input variable of customer.</div>
    <div>
      <center><img src="assets/carbon (18).png" width="600"></center>
    </div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">
      This next example features a template reference variable, #customerInput.
    </div>
    <div>
      <center><img src="assets/carbon (19).png" alt="" width="600"></center>
    </div>

    <div class="bg-sky-900 p-5 border-l-4 mt-8">Template expressions cannot refer to anything in the global namespace,
      except undefined. They can't refer to
      window or document. Additionally, they can't call console.log() or Math.max() and are restricted to referencing
      members of the expression context.</div>
    <div class="text-3xl mt-8">Preventing name collisions</div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">The context against which an expression evaluates is the union of the template variables,
      the directive's
      context object—if it has one—and the component's members. If you reference a name that belongs to more than one of
      these namespaces, Angular applies the following precedence logic to determine the context:
    </div>
    <ul class="list-disc mt-4 ml-8">
      <li class="mt-2">The template variable name.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-2">A name in the directive's context.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-2">The component's member names.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">To avoid variables shadowing variables in another context, keep variable names unique. In
      the following
      example, the AppComponent template greets the customer, Padma.</div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">An ngFor then lists each customer in the customers array.</div>
    <div>
      <center><img src="assets/carbon (20).png" width="600"></center>
    </div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">The customer within the ngFor is in the context of the implicit <ng-template> defined by
        the ngFor. It refers
        to each customer in the customers array and displays "Ebony" and "Chiho". "Padma" is not displayed because that
        name is not in that array.
    </div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">On the other hand, the <h1> displays "Padma" which is bound to the value of the customer
        property in the component class.</div>
    <div class="divider"></div>

    <div class="text-4xl mt-8">Expression best practices
    </div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">When using a template expression, follow these best practices:</div>
    <ul class="list-disc mt-4 ml-8">
      <li class="mt-2 font-bold">Use short expressions
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">
      Use property names or method calls whenever possible. Keep application and business logic in the component, where
      it is accessible to develop and test.
    </div>
    <ul class="list-disc mt-4 ml-8">
      <li class="mt-2 font-bold">Quick execution</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="mt-8">Angular executes a template expression after every change detection cycle. Many asynchronous
      activities trigger
      change detection cycles, such as promise resolutions, HTTP results, timer events, key presses, and mouse moves.
    </div>
    <div class="mt-8">An expression should finish quickly to keep the user experience as efficient as possible, especially on slower
      devices. Consider caching values when their computation requires greater resources.</div>
