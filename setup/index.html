      Setting up the local environment and workspace

      This guide explains how to set up your environment for Angular development using the Angular CLI tool. It includes
      information about prerequisites, installing the CLI, creating an initial workspace and starter app, and running
      that app locally to verify your setup.

      Prerequisites
    </div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">
      To use the Angular framework, you should be familiar with the following:
    </div>
    <ul class="list-disc mt-4 ml-8">
      <li class="mt-2">
        <a href="">JavaScript</a>
      </li>
      <li class="mt-2">
        <a href="">HTML</a>
      </li>
      <li class="mt-2">
        <a href="">CSS</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">
      Knowledge of <a>TypeScript</a> is helpful, but not required.
    </div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">
      To install Angular on your local system, you need the following:
    </div>
    <div>
      <table class="bg-sky-900 p-5 border-l-4 mt-8">
        <thead>
          <tr>

            <td class="p-5 border-l-4">Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular applications depend on npm packages for
              many features and
              functions. To download and install npm packages, you need an npm package manager. This guide uses the npm
              client command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default. To check that you have the npm
              client installed, run npm -v in a terminal window.</td>

    <div class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8">Install the Angular CLI</div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-8">You can use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, and
      perform a variety of
      ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.
    </div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-4">
      To install the Angular CLI, open a terminal window and run the following command:
    </div>
    <div class="mt-8"><code class="bg-slate-950 p-2 text-green-500 rounded">npm install -g @angular/cli</code></div>
    <div class="bg-sky-950 p-5 border-l-4 mt-8 p-3">
      On Windows client computers, the execution of PowerShell scripts is disabled by default. To allow the execution of
      PowerShell scripts, which is needed for npm global binaries, you must set the following execution policy:
      <br>
      <code
        class="bg-slate-950 p-2 text-green-500 rounded">Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned</code><br>
      Carefully read the message displayed after executing the command and follow the instructions. Make sure you
      understand the implications of setting an execution policy.

      Create a workspace and initial application
    </div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-4">
      You develop apps in the context of an Angular workspace. <br>
      To create a new workspace and initial starter app:
    </div>
    <ul class="list-disc mt-4 ml-8">
      <li class="mt-2">Run the CLI command ng new and provide the name my-app, as shown here:
        <code class="bg-slate-950 p-2 text-green-500 rounded">ng new my-app</code>
      </li>
      <li class="mt-2">
        The ng new command prompts you for information about features to include in the initial app. Accept the defaults
        by pressing the Enter or Return key.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="text-xl mt-4">
      The Angular CLI installs the necessary Angular npm packages and other dependencies. This can take a few minutes.
      <br>
      The CLI creates a new workspace and a simple Welcome app, ready to run.
    </div>
    <div class="divider"></div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <div class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8">
      Run the application
    </div>
    <div class="text-xl mt-4">
      The Angular CLI includes a server, for you to build and serve your app locally.
    </div>
    <ul class="list-disc mt-4 ml-8">
      <li class="mt-2">Navigate to the workspace folder, such as my-app.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-2">
        Run the following command: <br><code class="bg-slate-950 p-2 text-green-500 rounded">cd my-app <br>
          ng serve --open</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="text-xl mt-4">
      The ng serve command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those
      files. <br>
      The --open (or just -o) option automatically opens your browser to http://localhost:4200/. <br>

        To learn more about using the Angular CLI, see the CLI Overview. In addition to creating the initial workspace
        and app scaffolding, use the CLI to generate Angular code such as components and services. The CLI supports the
        full development cycle, including building, testing, bundling, and deployment.
