    <div class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8">Introduction to forms in Angular</div>
    <div class="mt-8">Handling user input with forms is the cornerstone of many common applications. Applications use
      forms to enable users to log in, to update a profile, to enter sensitive information, and to perform many other
      data-entry tasks.</div>
    <div class="mt-8">Angular provides two different approaches to handling user input through forms: reactive and
      template-driven. Both capture user input events from the view, validate the user input, create a form model and
      data model to update, and provide a way to track changes.</div>
    <div class="mt-8">This guide provides information to help you decide which type of form works best for your
      situation. It introduces the common building blocks used by both approaches. It also summarizes the key
      differences between the two approaches, and demonstrates those differences in the context of setup, data flow, and
      testing.

      offers different advantages.</div>

              Compared to template-driven

              they are more robust: they're more scalable, reusable, and testable. If forms are a key part of your
              application, or you're already using reactive patterns for building your application, use reactive forms.

            app, but they don't scale as well as reactive forms. If you have very basic form requirements and logic that
            can be managed solely in the template, template-driven forms could be a good fit.</td>

    <div class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8">Scalability</div>
    <div class="mt-8">If forms are a central part of your application, scalability is very important. Being able to
      reuse form models
      across components is critical.</div>
    <div class="mt-8">Reactive forms are more scalable than template-driven forms. They provide direct access to the
      underlying form
      API, and use synchronous data flow between the view and the data model, which makes creating large-scale forms
      easier. Reactive forms require less setup for testing, and testing does not require deep understanding of change
      detection to properly test form updates and validation.</div>
    <div class="mt-8">Template-driven forms focus on simple scenarios and are not as reusable. They abstract away the
      underlying form API, and use asynchronous data flow between the view and the data model. The abstraction of
      template-driven forms also affects testing. Tests are deeply reliant on manual change detection execution to run
      properly, and require more setup.

      users interact
      with and the form data in your component model. The two approaches share underlying building blocks, but differ in
